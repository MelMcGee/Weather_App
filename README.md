# Weather_App
C# ASP.NET MVC Web App that shows how to connect to a REST API, openweathermap.org, in a couple different ways.

Weather API Consumption Demo
To make use of this application, please register for an API key at http://openweathermap.org/api.

After receiving your APPID from openweathermap.org, change your appid strings in 2 places:

Views -> Home -> WeatherJS.cshtml (in the jQuery at the bottom)
Models -> Weather.cs
This app will not work unless you change your appid as stated above.
